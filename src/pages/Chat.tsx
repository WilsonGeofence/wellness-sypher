Managing diabetes requires a balanced approach to nutrition and exercise. Focus on eating whole, unprocessed foods with a good mix of fiber, healthy fats, and lean protein to help regulate blood sugar. Avoid refined carbs and sugary foods that can cause spikes.

For exercise, regular movement is keyâ€”aim for a mix of strength training and light cardio, like walking, to improve insulin sensitivity. Managing stress and getting enough sleep also play a big role in blood sugar control.
